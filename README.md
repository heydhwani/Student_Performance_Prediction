# 📚 Student Performance Prediction 

A machine learning-powered web API using **FastAPI** to predict the **final grade (G3)** of students based on demographic, academic, family, and personal data. This project is based on the [UCI Student Performance Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/320/student+performance).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts final student grade on a 0–20 scale.
- Organized input via four intuitive sections:
  - Student Details
  - Family Background
  - Academic Status
  - Health Status
- Categorical label encoding with automatic casing normalization.
- Grading remark generation (A+, B, C, etc.).
- Easy Flutter/mobile app integration.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.14.0

### Setup:
```bash
# Repository Name
Student_Performance_Prediction

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate 

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🏋️‍♂️ Model Training

To train or retrain the model using the dataset:

```bash
python Student_Performance_model.py
```

This will generate the model and encoder files:
- `student_performance_model.joblib`
- `label_encoders.joblib`

---

## 🚦 Running the API

Start the FastAPI server:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --reload
```

Navigate to:
- Swagger Docs: [http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs)
- Root: [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)

## 📊 Student Performance Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Portuguese Student Performance Dataset to understand data patterns, distributions, correlations, and important features for building machine-learning models.

### 📁 Dataset Path
```bash
Dataset/student_performance_portuguese_dataset.csv
```
### 🛠️Libraries Used
```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
```

## 🚀 EDA Script Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

###  1. Load Dataset & Show Basic Information
This displays:
- `First 5 rows`
- `Column data types`
- `Summary statistics`
- `Missing values in each column`

---

### 2. Histogram for Numeric Columns
Purpose:
- `Understand the distribution of numeric features`
- `Detect skewness`
- `Visualize spread`

---

### 3. Boxplots for Numeric Columns
Purpose:
- `Detect outliers`
- `Compare ranges of numeric variables`

---

### 4. Correlation Heatmap (Numeric Only)
Purpose:
- `Reveal relationships between features`
- `Identify highly correlated variables`
- `Understand influence on final grades`
---

## ▶️ How to Run the EDA Script
1.Install dependencies
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```
2.Run the script
```bash
python eda.py
```

---



## 🖼️ Enhancement Ideas

- Show emoji/photo based on grade in frontend.
- Implement history tracking per student.
- Deploy via Render, Vercel, or Docker.
